# ✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This repository contains a simple, functional implementation of the classic game, Rock, Paper, Scissors. The project is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and was created as an assignment focused on demonstrating core programming concepts.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to implement robust **conditional logic** to determine the winner of each game round. The logic specifically relies on the comprehensive use of **`if` and `else if` statements** to cover all nine possible outcomes (Win, Lose, Draw) between the player and the computer.

## ✨ Core Features

* **Random Computer Choice:** Uses JavaScript's built-in functions to generate a randomized choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for the computer player.
* **Comprehensive Logic:** All rules of the game (Rock > Scissors, Scissors > Paper, Paper > Rock) are handled through explicit conditional statements.
* **Basic I/O:** Utilizes simple JavaScript methods (e.g., `prompt()` for user input and `alert()` for output) to manage the game flow.


## 🛠️ Technology Used

* **HTML5** (For basic page structure)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** (For all game logic)
* **CSS** (For styling)
